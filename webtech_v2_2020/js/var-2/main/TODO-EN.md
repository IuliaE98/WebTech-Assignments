- a `Duck` is constructed based on a string name
- a `Duck` can swim
- a `RubberDuck` can float

- if a rubber duck is instructed to float it will return a string saying it floats (e.g. if the rubber duck is named `Donald` then the returned string is `Donald floats`); (0.5 pts)
- if a rubber duck is instructed to swim it will return a string saying cannot swim (e.g. if the rubber duck is named `Donald` then the returned string is `Donald can't swim, only float`); (0.5 pts)
